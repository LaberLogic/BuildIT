# ADR-002: Technology Stack Selection

## Context

This project requires a modern, scalable, and maintainable technology stack for a web application serving construction company management needs. The system will include a frontend user interface and a backend API server, handling authentication, data access, and business logic. Key requirements include performance, developer productivity, maintainability, and good ecosystem support.

## Decision

- **Frontend:** Nuxt 3 (Vue 3) framework to build a Single Page Application (SPA) with server-side rendering capabilities for SEO benefits and enhanced user experience.
- **Backend:** Fastify with TypeScript to implement a high-performance REST API backend. Fastify was chosen for its speed, plugin architecture, and strong typing support.
- **Shared:** Use TypeScript across both frontend and backend for type safety and consistency.

## Consequences

- **Benefits:**
  - Nuxt 3 offers out-of-the-box SSR and static generation capabilities, improving SEO and load times.
  - Vue 3’s composition API and reactive model improve frontend maintainability.
  - Fastify’s performance and plugin ecosystem suit the API needs.
  - TypeScript ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.

- **Trade-offs:**
  - Learning curve for Nuxt 3 and Fastify if new to the team.
  - Possible complexity in monorepo management with shared types.
  - SSR adds complexity compared to a pure SPA.
