# 10. Quality Requirements {#section-quality-scenarios}

## 10.1 Quality Tree {#_quality_tree}

The following quality attributes are prioritized for the Construction Management Platform:

1. **Performance**
   - The system shall respond to user interactions within 1 second under typical load.
   - API endpoints must process requests within 300ms on average.

2. **Reliability**
   - The platform shall be available 99.9% of the time.
   - All critical operations (e.g., assigning workers, material tracking) must guarantee data consistency.

3. **Security**
   - User authentication and authorization must be enforced on all API endpoints.
   - Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
   - GDPR compliance is mandatory for all personal data processing.

4. **Maintainability**
   - The codebase should be modular and layered to facilitate independent updates.
   - Automated tests must cover at least 80% of the backend and frontend code.

5. **Scalability**
   - The system must support multiple construction companies with isolated data.
   - The architecture shall allow adding new tenants without downtime.

6. **Usability**
   - The web frontend shall support responsive design for desktop and mobile use.
   - Common workflows (e.g., site check-in, material requests) must be intuitive and require minimal training.

### Usage Scenarios

| ID   | Quality Attribute | Scenario                                                                                                     | Expected Result                                      |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| QS-1  | Performance       | A Construction Manager submits a new site assignment via the frontend under normal network conditions.       | Response within 1 second; site is available immediately. |
| QS-2  | Reliability       | Multiple users simultaneously update material deliveries on different job sites.                             | Data remains consistent; no lost updates or conflicts.  |
| QS-3  | Security          | An unauthorized user attempts to access the API endpoints.                                                  | Access denied with proper error response (401/403).       |
| QS-4  | Scalability       | A new tenant company signs up and begins using the platform.                                                | New tenant isolated; no impact on existing tenants.       |
| QS-5  | Usability         | A Site Worker accesses the platform via a mobile device to check in on a site.                              | The interface adapts correctly and all required functions are accessible. |

|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| CS-1  | Maintainability   | The development team adds support for a new material type without downtime.                                 | New feature deployed with automated tests passing and no regression. |
| CS-2  | Security         | A GDPR regulation update requires changes to data storage and access controls.                             | Changes implemented and verified within 2 weeks; compliance maintained. |

These quality requirements guide architectural decisions such as using a layered architecture, integrating Prisma ORM for data consistency, and choosing Nuxt 3 for a responsive SPA frontend.
