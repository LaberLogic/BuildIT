## 11.1 Risks

| ID   | Risk Description                                                                                      | Impact                    | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| R-1   | Single third-party dependency on Mailgun for email delivery could cause system notification failures | Medium                    | Medium     | Implement fallback email provider or alerting  |
| R-2   | Performance degradation under high load due to monolithic backend architecture                      | High                      | Low        | Monitor performance; consider microservices if needed |
| R-3   | Security vulnerabilities due to improper validation or authorization gaps                           | High                      | Medium     | Enforce strict input validation (Zod), use role guards, conduct security audits |
| R-4   | Data inconsistency risks from concurrent database updates                                           | High                      | Low        | Use Prisma transactions and database constraints |
| R-5   | GDPR compliance risk if personal data handling is incorrect                                        | High                      | Low        | Regular compliance reviews; automated data audits |
| R-6   | Developer onboarding difficulties due to complexity or lack of documentation                       | Medium                    | Medium     | Maintain clear architecture documentation and coding standards |

## 11.2 Technical Debt

| ID   | Area                         | Description                                                                              | Impact                           | Remediation Plan                               |
|-------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| TD-1  | API Layer                    | Some API routes lack complete automated test coverage                                  | Reduced confidence in deployments | Add missing unit and integration tests         |
| TD-2  | Frontend Codebase            | Inconsistent component styling and duplicated code in UI modules                       | Increased maintenance effort     | Refactor UI components; enforce style guides   |
| TD-3  | Database Migrations          | Manual intervention sometimes needed during migrations                                | Deployment delays and risks      | Automate migration validation and rollback     |
| TD-4  | Shared DTOs and Validation   | Limited shared validation schemas cause duplication between frontend and backend       | Higher chance of validation errors | Expand shared schemas and enforce usage        |
| TD-5  | Monitoring and Logging       | Insufficient centralized logging and alerting for backend errors                      | Delayed issue detection          | Integrate centralized logging and alert system |
